Here is a "minimum effective dose" approach inspired by Tim Ferriss's philosophy.
The "One Index Card" Method
This is the easiest, most effective starting point. The goal is not to manage his entire life, but to win the day.
The Tools:
• A stack of 3x5 index cards.
• A pen he likes using.
The System (The Minimum Effective Dose):
1. The Night Before: Before going to bed (or first thing in the morning), he takes out one index card.
2. Identify the "Big One": He asks himself, "What is the one thing that if I get it done tomorrow, will make the day a success?" He writes that one task at the top of the card. This might be "Finish Chapter 7 reading" or "Write the outline for my history paper."
3. Add 2-3 "Smaller Things": Below the "Big One," he writes 2 or 3 smaller, essential tasks. These could be things like "Do laundry," "Email Professor Smith," or "Go to the gym."
4. That's It. The list should not have more than 4 items total. The physical limitation of the card is a feature, not a bug. It forces prioritization and prevents overwhelm.
How to Use It:
• Keep it Visible: The card stays on his desk, next to his computer, or in his pocket all day. It must be visible.
• Focus on the "Big One" First: He should try to tackle the most important task first, if possible.
• Cross Off with Gusto: Physically crossing an item off the list provides a small dopamine hit and a sense of accomplishment.  
• At the End of the Day, Throw it Away: Whether he finished everything or not, the card gets ripped up or thrown out. Tomorrow is a new day with a new card. This prevents the guilt of a long, migrating "to-do" list.
Why This Works (Especially for ADHD):
• Extremely Low Friction: There are no apps to download, settings to configure, or complex rules to learn. It takes 60 seconds.
• Combats Overwhelm: An endless digital list can be paralyzing. A card with only 3-4 items feels manageable and achievable.
• Outsources Executive Function: It removes the burden of trying to hold all the day's tasks in his working memory, freeing up mental bandwidth.
• Forces Prioritization: The limited space forces him to decide what is actually important versus what is just "busy work."
• Creates Momentum: Successfully completing a short list builds confidence and creates a positive feedback loop, making it more likely he'll do it again the next day.
